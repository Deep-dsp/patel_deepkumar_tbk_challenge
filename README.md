# TBK - FRONTEND CHALLENGE

Try to match provided design as close as possible and perform following requirements to complete the challenge.


- a popup that displays on a website once a visitor has been on a website for 3 seconds.
- Make the design into a responsive popover. Account for all breakpoints between desktop (1200px) and mobile (320px). The popover should look good on all breakpoints.
- Make the popover and form accessible (AODA/WCAG). Keypoints: I must be able to navigate the popover via keyboard and I must be able to close it via keyboard too. Ensure the form is accessible too.
- If the popover is closed, the popover should not deploy on any subsequent reloads/pageviews.
- There are two visual elements on the page that need to animate when the popover is scrolled: The chisel on the left needs to animate up slowly when the popover is scrolled down and the shavings on the right need to animate downwards slowly. Kind of like a neat parallax effect.
